## Telecom-Churn-Case-Study
Group Members- Jeena Pandit, Dewesh Dubey

### Business Goal
Retaining high profitable customers is the number one business goal. To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn. In this project, you will use the usage-based definition to define churn.

In this project, we have to -
- Analyze customer-level data of a leading telecom firm
- Build predictive models to :
    - identify customers at high risk of churn 
    - identify the main indicators of churn.
